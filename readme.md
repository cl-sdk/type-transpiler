# domain dsl

This project provides a DSL for writing your domain types
and generate code for any target language (currently kotlin, swift, soon javascript).

It doesn't compile complicated or weird features of any language,
but, instead, use the common objects that gives approximately the same meaning
(structures, classes, data types).

NOTE: Still need a little bit of refactoring and a better design,
but it's good enough for now.

See the POC branch for to see the project.
